Monte Carlo model for a voting environment.  Model features: each voter has a probabilistic fixed preference, voter can vote strategically, each candidate is mapped to a 2-D preference space with a dynamic position, and there are many more voters than candidates.  Used for comparing the results of various voting systems (e.g. first past the poll, instant run-off, ranked-pair).  In particular how strategic voting can affect results in each, and how introduction/removal of candidate will can results.
